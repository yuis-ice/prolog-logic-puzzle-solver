## Project Overview
This is a React TypeScript application using Tau Prolog and WASM for logic puzzle solving capabilities.

## Key Technologies
- React with TypeScript
- Vite for build tooling
- Tau Prolog for logic programming
- WASM for performance-critical operations

## Architecture Guidelines
- Keep logic puzzle definitions in Prolog format
- Use React hooks for state management
- Implement puzzle solving with Tau Prolog engine
- Ensure type safety with TypeScript interfaces

## Code Style
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper TypeScript types for all Prolog interactions
